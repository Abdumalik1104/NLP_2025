The CECL method relies on color and shape cues that\\ndistinguish the iris from other facial structures. The accuracy of the CECL\\nmethod is demonstrated through a comparison with 15 state-of-the-art eye center\\nlocalization methods against five error thresholds, as reported in the\\nliterature. The CECL method achieved an accuracy of 80.8% to 99.4% and ranked\\nfirst for 2 of the 5 thresholds. It is concluded that the CECL method offers an\\nattractive alternative to existing methods for automatic eye center\\nlocalization.\",\n          \"Indoor scene recognition is a multi-faceted and challenging problem due to\\nthe diverse intra-class variations and the confusing inter-class similarities.\\nThis paper presents a novel approach which exploits rich mid-level\\nconvolutional features to categorize indoor scenes. Traditionally used\\nconvolutional features preserve the global spatial structure, which is a\\ndesirable property for general object recognition. However, we argue that this\\nstructuredness is not much helpful when we have large variations in scene\\nlayouts, e.g., in indoor scenes. We propose to transform the structured\\nconvolutional activations to another highly discriminative feature space. The\\nrepresentation in the transformed space not only incorporates the\\ndiscriminative aspects of the target dataset, but it also encodes the features\\nin terms of the general object categories that are present in indoor scenes. To\\nthis end, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of 1300 object categories\\nwhich are commonly present in indoor scenes. Our proposed approach achieves a\\nsignificant performance boost over previous state of the art approaches on five\\nmajor scene classification datasets.\",\n          \"In many datasets, different parts of the data may have their own patterns of\\ncorrelation, a structure that can be modeled as a mixture of local linear\\ncorrelation models. The task of finding these mixtures is known as correlation\\nclustering. In this work, we propose a linear correlation clustering method for\\ndatasets whose features are pre-divided into two views. The method, called\\nCanonical Least Squares (CLS) clustering, is inspired by multi-output\\nregression and Canonical Correlation Analysis. CLS clusters can be interpreted\\nas variations in the regression relationship between the two views. The method\\nis useful for data mining and data interpretation. Its utility is demonstrated\\non a synthetic dataset and stock market dataset.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'term': 'cs.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\",\n          \"[{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\",\n          \"[{'term': 'cs.CL', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Circle-based Eye Center Localization (CECL)\",\n          \"A Discriminative Representation of Convolutional Features for Indoor\\n  Scene Recognition\",\n          \"Learning Mixtures of Multi-Output Regression Models by Correlation\\n  Clustering for Multi-View Data\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2013,\n        \"max\": 2017,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2017,\n          2015,\n          2013\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-1f69a995-f9df-4c04-9cdf-e9d8d43ff898\" class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eauthor\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eday\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eid\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003elink\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003emonth\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esummary\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etag\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etitle\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eyear\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e16733\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'name': 'Enes Avcu'}, {'name': 'Chihiro Shib...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e16\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1705.05940v3\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'rel': 'alternate', 'href': 'http://arxiv.or...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e5\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eThis paper argues that the judicial use of for...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'term': 'cs.CL', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eSubregular Complexity and Deep Learning\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2017\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e25191\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'name': 'Yustinus Eko Soelistio'}, {'name': ...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e15\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1506.04500v2\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'rel': 'related', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e6\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eWe propose an improved eye center localization...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'term': 'cs.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eCircle-based Eye Center Localization (CECL)\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e7046\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'name': 'Eric Lei'}, {'name': 'Kyle Miller'}...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e17\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1709.05602v1\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'rel': 'alternate', 'href': 'http://arxiv.or...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eIn many datasets, different parts of the data ...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.o...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eLearning Mixtures of Multi-Output Regression M...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2017\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e19247\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'name': 'Henry E.
